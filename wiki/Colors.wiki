==How to add colors==
Custom colors are defined in _PLUGINS_PATH/Extensions/Mediaplayer2/subtitles/colors.txt_

===Format of colors.txt===
There are two columns *alias* and *rrggbb*
  * *alias* - alias of your custom color(one word)
  * *rrggbb* - hexadecimal notation of color - combination of red, green and blue
Every row with correct atributes represents custom color
