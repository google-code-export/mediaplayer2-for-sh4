===If its critical error (Green screen) and you have mounted hdd===

You can obtain log in directory _/media/hdd_ in format _enigma2_crash_xxxxxxxxxx.log_. There can be more of them, send me the most recently created.

===If its not a critical error, or you dont have mounted hdd, you can create log like this===


You have to connect to satellite receiver by telnet and set in console following commands:

 * *init 4* - turns off enigma2  
 * *enigma2 2> /tmp/e2.log* -turns on enigma2 and log is writing into  _/tmp/e2.log_
Now you need to get to your problem/error. As soon as you do that you can exit enigma2(in case its not critical error).
 * *killall enigma2* - turns off enigma2
 * *init 3* - enigma2 will be started in default mode

Finally log is in the _/tmp/e2.log_ file.
